# Refugee Timeline

see also information on [Launchrock](http://refugee-timeline.launchrock.com)

This project was initiated during the 2016 HackForHumans hackathon in Osnabr√ºck. It was created to provide assistance for refugees by showing the necessary steps to reach so-called goals, like for example to achieve a residence permission or continue studies. The information is shown as a timeline, which is generated based on the selected goal and personal information.

There is an android application under development, but currently it is a very basic prototype and not nearly finished for release yet.

## What still needs to be done

*  Design and implement a data backend (database), capable of representing the whole complexity of the German legal system
*  Design and implement a sync mechanism to update local data
*  Android App: Request user information to be used in determining needed tasks
*  Get the data: The information about the legal steps necessary to be granted asylum as an example
*  Design and implement a frontend for filling in data into the database, so that organizations can extend the dataset with e.g. localized content

## We need support!

There are still many things that need to be done to create a running application. Development stage is pre-alpha, a lot is going to change in the future. In order to get a running app which can be released, more code has to be written and more information has to be researched to fill it. Especially there are many legal paragraphs involved which need to be simplified and inserted into the dataset so even Germans can understand their legal system ;) . **Any help for creating and maintaining the application is appreciated!**
